# Etch-a-Sketch Project

This is a simple Etch-a-Sketch project implemented using JavaScript and HTML/CSS. It allows users to draw on a grid-like canvas by hovering over the grid cells with the mouse cursor.

## Features

- Adjustable grid size: Users can select the number of rows and columns to create a grid of their desired size.
- Drawing functionality: Users can draw by hovering the mouse cursor over the grid cells, leaving a trail.
- Clear functionality: Users can clear the grid and start over with a clean canvas.
- Dynamic resizing: The grid and grid cells adjust their size based on the user's input.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for creating the structure of the webpage.
- CSS: Used for styling the webpage and grid.
- JavaScript: Used for implementing the Etch-a-Sketch functionality.
- DOM Manipulation: Utilized to dynamically create, modify, and interact with HTML elements.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The default grid size is 16x16. To change the grid size, use the range slider provided on the page to adjust the number of rows and columns.
3. Hover over the grid cells to draw. The color of the cells will change as you hover over them.
4. To clear the grid, click the "Clear" button.

## Future Enhancements

- Color selection: Allow users to choose different colors for drawing.
- Additional drawing tools: Implement different drawing tools, such as a pen, pencil, or brush with varying thickness.
- Save and load functionality: Enable users to save their drawings or load previous ones.
- User interface improvements: Enhance the design and user experience of the Etch-a-Sketch application.
